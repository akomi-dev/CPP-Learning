**Bjarne Stroustrup**  born 30 December 1950) is a Danish [computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist "Computer scientist"), most notable for the invention and development of the [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") programming language. Stroustrup served as a visiting professor of computer science at [Columbia University in the City of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University") beginning in 2014, where he has been a full professor since 2022.

## C++

Stroustrup is best known for his work on C++. In 1979, he began developing C++ (initially called "[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)") with Classes"). In his own words, he "invented C++, wrote its early definitions, and produced its first implementation (...) chose and formulated the design criteria for C++, designed all its major facilities, and was responsible for the processing of extension proposals in the C++ standards committee." C++ was made generally available in 1985. For non-commercial use, the source code of the compiler and the foundation libraries was the cost of shipping (US$75); this was before Internet access was common. Stroustrup also published a textbook for the language in 1985, _[The C++ Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C%2B%2B_Programming_Language "The C++ Programming Language")_.

The key language-technical areas of contribution of C++ are:

- A static type system with equal support for built-in types and user-defined types (that requires control of the construction, destruction, copying, and movement of objects; and [operator overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading "Operator overloading")).
- Value and reference semantics.
- Systematic and general resource management ([RAII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization "Resource acquisition is initialization")): constructors, destructor, and exceptions relying on them.
- Support for efficient object-oriented programming: based on the [Simula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula "Simula") model with statically checked interfaces, [multiple inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance "Multiple inheritance"), and efficient implementation based on [virtual function tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table "Virtual method table").
- Support for flexible and efficient [generic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming "Generic programming"): templates with specialization and concepts.
- Support for compile-time programming: [template metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming "Template metaprogramming") and compile-time evaluated functions ("constexpr functions").
- Direct use of machine and operating system resources.
- Concurrency support through libraries (where necessary, implemented using intrinsics).

Stroustrup documented his principles guiding the design of C++ and the evolution of the language in his 1994 book, _The Design and Evolution of C++_, and three papers for ACM's History of Programming Languages conferences.

Stroustrup was a founding member of the C++ standards committee (from 1989, it was an ANSI committee and from 1991 an ISO committee) and has remained an active member ever since. For 24 years he chaired the subgroup chartered to handle proposals for language extensions (Evolution Working Group).
