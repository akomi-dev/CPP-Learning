C++ has many functions that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

Some math functions can be accessed without the `cmath` library such as min and max:
```C++
cout << max(5, 10); // 10
cout << min(5, 10); // 5
```

Other math functions require the `cmath` library:

```C++
// Include the cmath library
#include <cmath>

cout << sqrt(64);
cout << round(2.6);
cout << log(2);
```
